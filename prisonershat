You and nine other individuals have been captured by a super-intelligent alien overlord. The aliens believe that humans might be tasty but are unsure whether humans qualify as highly intelligent and cooperative beings, which their civilisation forbids them from consuming. To test your intelligence and cooperation, the aliens present you with a challenge.

The aliens explain the rules as follows: You will be arranged in a single file line, facing forward, with the individuals in size order so that each of you can see everyone lined up in front of you. It is important to note that you will not be able to look behind you or step out of the line. Before the game begins, each of you will be randomly assigned either a white or black hat. You will not know the total number of white and black hats assigned. The task is for each person, starting from the back of the line, to guess the colour of their own hat. The guesses will proceed one by one, moving towards the front of the line. If at least nine of you guess the colour of your own hat correctly, all of you will be spared. You are now given the opportunity to discuss with the other prisoners and come up with a strategy to save everyone before the game starts.
