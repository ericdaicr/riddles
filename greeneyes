Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians, are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There is no escape except for one strange rule: any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, they will be released. If not, they will be tossed into the volcano. 

In fact, all 100 prisoners have green eyes. They have live there since birth, and the dictator has ensured they can’t learn their own eye colour. There are no reflective surfaces. All water is in opaque containers. And most importantly, they are not allowed to communicate among themselves. They do see each other during each morning’s headcount. Nevertheless, they all know that no one would ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. 

After much pressure from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them any new information. What can you say to help free all the prisoners without incurring the dictator’s wrath?
